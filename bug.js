This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data is available.  For example, consider this code:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userData: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ userData: data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.userData.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

If the `fetch` request hasn't completed, `this.state.userData` will be `null`, causing a `TypeError`. This is especially problematic because the error might not appear consistently during development and the app might only crash intermittently.
